# #TidyTuesday Week 1 Challenge ðŸ›  Bring Your Own Data

## Objective ðŸ§¾
The objective was to bring your own data for cleaning, analysis and visualization

## Decision ðŸ’¡
I decided to carry out a fairly simple task for the challenge. Since I was interested in creating a word cloud for the most popular words in my last 100 tweets, I got to collect the tweets through Twitter API ~ [Collecting Twitter Data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/auth.html) ~ and did the necessary cleaning, analysis and visualization
